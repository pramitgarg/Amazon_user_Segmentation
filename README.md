# Amazon customer Segmentation 

# Overview 

The dataset contains a combination of product and customer review data. We aim to cluster users into different segment based on:
* Review Behaviour
* Ratings Given
* Product Preferences
* Sentiment of their reviews.
  
# 🛠️ Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and explored customer behavior.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created features like Total Spend, Frequency, and Recency.
3. **Clustering:** Applied K-Means clustering and determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
4. **Visualization & Insights:** Visualized customer segments to understand their characteristics.

📚 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

# Here are some questions which will be answered during this project:

1. Which user segments are most valuable to Amazon (high spend, high rating)?
2. Do discount seekers leave lower ratings?
3. What is the average review count per user in each segment?
4. Are certain product categories more common in specific user segments?
5. Which users are brand advocates (write positive reviews for many products)?
